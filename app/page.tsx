    question: "How quickly can you fund a hard money loan in California?",
    answer: "We can provide term sheets within 24-72 hours and close most loans in 10-21 days. For fix and flip loans with clear exit strategies, we often close in as little as 7 days."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the qualification requirements for DSCR loans?",
    answer: "DSCR loans qualify based on the property's rental income, not your personal income. We typically require a DSCR of 1.0 or higher, good credit (typically 680+), and sufficient assets for down payment and reserves."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you lend throughout all of California?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide hard money loans, DSCR loans, and fix & flip financing throughout California, including all major metros like Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Sacramento, and beyond."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of properties do you finance?",
    answer: "We finance single-family homes, condos, townhomes, 2-4 unit properties, and some commercial properties. Properties can be owner-occupied, investment rentals, or fix-and-flip projects."
  },
  {
    question: "What are typical interest rates for hard money loans?",
    answer: "Our rates typically range from 7.5% to 12% depending on the loan type, property, borrower experience, and loan-to-value ratio. DSCR loans tend to have lower rates than fix & flip loans."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I borrow?",
    answer: "We provide loans from $75,000 to $5,000,000+. Loan amounts depend on the property value, your experience, and the specific loan program."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the typical loan-to-value (LTV) ratios?",
    answer: "LTV ratios vary by program: DSCR loans up to 80% LTV, fix & flip loans up to 90% of the After Repair Value (ARV), and bridge loans typically 70-80% LTV."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you require a down payment?",
    answer: "Yes, down payment requirements vary by loan type. DSCR loans typically require 20-25% down, while fix & flip loans may require 10-30% depending on your experience and the project."

              California's robust real estate market offers tremendous opportunities for investors, from the tech-driven markets 
              of San Francisco and San Jose to the entertainment hub of Los Angeles and the growing economies of Sacramento and San Diego. 
              Understanding local market dynamics is crucial for successful real estate investment throughout the Golden State.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              <strong>Value-Add Opportunities:</strong> Many California markets present excellent value-add opportunities, particularly 
              in areas experiencing urban renewal or infrastructure improvements. DSCR loans are particularly valuable in these scenarios, 
              allowing investors to qualify based on the property's rental income potential rather than personal income verification. 
              This is especially beneficial for investors building portfolios across multiple California metros.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Short-Term Rental Considerations:</strong> California's diverse tourism markets, from Napa Valley to coastal areas, 
              create opportunities for short-term rental investments. However, investors should carefully research local STR regulations, 
              as many California cities have specific compliance requirements. Our team stays current on local regulations to help structure 
              loans appropriately for your investment strategy. <em>This information is for general guidance only and should not be considered legal advice.</em>
