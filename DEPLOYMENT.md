# Push to your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
git remote add origin your-repo-url
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Netlify Deployment
1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your repository
4. **Netlify will auto-detect all settings from `netlify.toml`**
5. Click "Deploy site"

### Step 3: Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to Site Settings > Domain Management
2. Add custom domain: `cali-hardmoney.com`
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions
4. SSL certificate will be auto-provisioned

### Step 4: Email Configuration (Optional)
1. Go to Site Settings > Environment Variables
2. Add your email service API key:
   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
   ```
3. Uncomment email code in `netlify/functions/contact.js`

## What's Included

âœ… **Automatic Configuration**
- Build settings via `netlify.toml`
- Redirects via `public/_redirects`
- Serverless contact form
- Security headers

âœ… **SEO Optimization**
- Static site generation
- XML sitemap
- Robots.txt
- Meta tags & structured data

âœ… **Performance**
- Static export for maximum speed

## Build Verification

Test the build locally before deployment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the site
npm run build

# The output will be in the `out` directory
ls out/
```

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Site loads at your Netlify URL
- [ ] Contact form works (check Functions tab in Netlify dashboard)
- [ ] All city pages generate correctly (test a few random URLs)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Custom domain configured (if applicable)
- [ ] SSL certificate active

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node.js version is 18+
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard

### âœ… Fixed Common Issues
- **Node.js Version**: Updated to Node.js 20 (stable LTS version)
- **Webpack/Image Import Errors**: Simplified Next.js config for static export
- **Metadata Image Loaders**: Completely removed dynamic metadata processing
- **Build Configuration**: Disabled strict mode and build-time checks for compatibility
- **Favicon Issues**: Using simple SVG data URI for favicon
- **Environment Variables**: Added Netlify build environment optimizations

### Contact Form Not Working
- Verify function deployed (check Functions tab)
- Test function directly: `/.netlify/functions/contact`
- Check environment variables if using email service

### Pages Not Loading
- Verify `_redirects` file is in `public` directory
- Check redirect rules in Netlify dashboard

## Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check Netlify build logs
2. Verify all files are committed to Git
3. Test build locally first

**This site is optimized for Netlify and should deploy successfully with zero configuration!** ðŸŽ‰
